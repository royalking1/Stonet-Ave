## Sample Code Snippets

### 1. Multi-URL Video Player (React + Video.js)

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import videojs from 'video.js';
import 'video.js/dist/video-js.css';

const MultiUrlPlayer = ({ sources }) => {
  const videoNode = useRef(null);
  const player = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    player.current = videojs(videoNode.current, {
      controls: true,
      preload: 'auto',
      sources: sources.map(src => ({ src: src.url, type: src.type })),
    });
    return () => {
      if (player.current) player.current.dispose();
    };
  }, [sources]);

  return (
    <div>
      <div data-vjs-player>
        <video ref={videoNode} className="video-js vjs-big-play-centered" />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MultiUrlPlayer;
```

**Usage:**

```jsx
const sources = [
  { url: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=someid', type: 'video/youtube' },
